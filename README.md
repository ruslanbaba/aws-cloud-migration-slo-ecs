# AWS Cloud Migration & SLO Implementation

Enterprise-level framework for migrating legacy .NET applications from on-premises VMware to AWS ECS with comprehensive SLO monitoring and implementation.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This solution provides a complete migration framework featuring:

- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform) for AWS ECS deployment
- **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** with 99.95% uptime target
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** using CloudWatch Synthetics and Dashboards
- **Security Best Practices** with IAM roles, security groups, and secrets management
- **Cost Optimization** strategies and monitoring
- **CI/CD Pipeline** for automated deployments
- **Disaster Recovery** and backup strategies

## 🎯 Target SLOs

| SLO Type | Target | Measurement |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Availability | 99.95% | CloudWatch Synthetics |
| Latency (P95) | < 500ms | Application Load Balancer metrics |
| Error Rate | < 0.1% | Application and infrastructure logs |
| Recovery Time | < 15 minutes | Automated failover testing |

## 🏢 Enterprise Features

- **Multi-Environment Support** (dev, staging, prod)
- **Zero-downtime Deployments** with blue-green deployment strategy
- **Automated Scaling** based on demand
- **Comprehensive Logging** and monitoring
- **Security Compliance** (SOC2, ISO27001 ready)
- **Cost Management** and optimization
- **Backup and Recovery** automation

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install required tools
   terraform --version  # >= 1.0
   aws --version       # >= 2.0
   docker --version    # >= 20.0
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Configure AWS credentials (use IAM roles in production)
   aws configure

   # Initialize Terraform
   cd terraform/environments/dev
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Plan and apply infrastructure
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Deploy Application**
   ```bash
   # Build and deploy via CI/CD pipeline
   git push origin main
   ```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0
- AWS CLI >= 2.0
- Docker >= 20.0
- .NET Core SDK (for local development)

## 🔐 Security

- All credentials managed via AWS Secrets Manager
- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- VPC with private subnets for application tier
- Security groups with minimal required access
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security scanning and compliance checks

## 📈 Monitoring & Observability

- CloudWatch Synthetics for availability monitoring
- Custom CloudWatch dashboards for business metrics
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Real-time alerting via SNS/Slack integration

## 💰 Cost Optimization

- Right-sizing recommendations
- Reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Automated scaling policies
- Cost budgets and alerts
- Regular cost review and optimization
