# ADR-001: AWS ECS as Container Orchestration Platform

**Date**: 2025-01-11  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Platform Team, DevOps Engineering, SRE Team  

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to migrate a legacy .NET application from on-premises VMware infrastructure to AWS cloud while implementing comprehensive SLO monitoring. The solution must provide:

- High availability and scalability
- 99.95% uptime SLO
- Cost optimization
- Enterprise-grade security
- Simplified operations and maintenance

## Decision Drivers

- **SLO Requirements**: 99.95% availability, <500ms P95 latency, <0.1% error rate
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle traffic spikes automatically
- **Cost Optimization**: 28% cost reduction target
- **Security**: Enterprise compliance requirements
- **Operational Simplicity**: Managed services preferred
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability and SLO tracking

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Amazon ECS with Fargate
- Fully managed container orchestration
- Serverless compute for containers
- Integrated with AWS ecosystem
- Built-in load balancing and auto-scaling

### Option 2: Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)
- Industry-standard Kubernetes
- More control over orchestration
- Larger ecosystem and community
- More complex operational overhead

### Option 3: AWS App Runner
- Simplest deployment model
- Limited configuration options
- Less control over infrastructure
- Newer service with fewer features

### Option 4: EC2 Auto Scaling Groups
- Traditional approach
- More operational overhead
- Less container-native features
- Manual container orchestration

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: Amazon ECS with Fargate**

### Positive Consequences
- **Simplified Operations**: No cluster management required
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for running tasks
- **Security**: Task-level isolation and built-in security features
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with ALB, CloudWatch, IAM
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand
- **SLO Compliance**: Built-in health checks and deployment strategies

### Negative Consequences
- **Vendor Lock-in**: AWS-specific orchestration platform
- **Limited Customization**: Less flexibility compared to Kubernetes
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn ECS-specific concepts

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Components
1. **ECS Cluster**: Container orchestration platform
2. **Fargate**: Serverless compute engine
3. **Application Load Balancer**: Traffic distribution and health checks
4. **Auto Scaling**: Automatic capacity management
5. **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and SLO tracking
6. **VPC**: Network isolation and security

### SLO Implementation
- **Availability**: CloudWatch Synthetics for continuous monitoring
- **Latency**: ALB metrics for response time tracking
- **Error Rate**: HTTP status code analysis
- **Alerting**: Real-time notifications for SLO violations

### Security Measures
- VPC with private subnets for application tier
- Security groups with minimal required access
- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- WAF for application protection
- Secrets Manager for sensitive data

## Compliance with Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 99.95% Availability | ECS service with multi-AZ deployment, health checks | ✅ |
| <500ms P95 Latency | Auto-scaling, performance monitoring | ✅ |
| <0.1% Error Rate | Application health checks, circuit breakers | ✅ |
| Cost Optimization | Fargate Spot, right-sizing, monitoring | ✅ |
| Security | WAF, VPC, IAM, encryption | ✅ |
| Monitoring | CloudWatch dashboards, synthetics, alarms | ✅ |
